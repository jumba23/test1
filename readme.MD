## Foxtrot's first GitHub repo!

## Git process

- Create a repo
- Clone the repo --> there is a repo on GitHun and you need it locally 
    - local - your computer
    - remote - GitHub, the cloud

- Make a file - touch <new-file-name>
    - Make sure you are inside the repo - cd repo-name
    - Naming conventions - lowercase, no spaces
    - Extension - which type of file

- Added content
- Added the PAT authentication

- Local --> remote 
    - git status
    - git add . (side note: you can do git add <filename>)
    - git commit -m "message" - like a patch note. Make it so others and your future self know what this commit actually did.
    - git push origin <branch-name>
